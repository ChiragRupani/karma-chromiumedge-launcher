[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/chiragrupani/chromium-edge-launcher/_apis/build/status/ChiragRupani.karma-chromiumedge-launcher?branchName=master)](https://github.com/ChiragRupani/karma-chromiumedge-launcher)

> Launcher for Chromium Edge Canary, Dev, Beta and Stable channels for Windows OS, Mac OS and Linux OS

Available in [NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chiragrupani/karma-chromium-edge-launcher)

## Installation

Install the package as dev-dependency

```bash
npm i -D @chiragrupani/karma-chromium-edge-launcher
```

## Configuration

Update `Karma.conf.js` replace or append to array of browsers and add require plugin as below:

```diff
// karma.conf.js
module.exports = function (config) {
  config.set({
-     browsers: ['Chrome'],
+     browsers: ['Edge'],
    plugins: [
-      require('karma-chrome-launcher'),
+      require('@chiragrupani/karma-chromium-edge-launcher'),
    ],
  });
};
```

Following browser channels are supported, add corresponding string in browsers:

- "Edge"
- "EdgeDev"
- "EdgeBeta"
- "EdgeCanary"

If you want to launch browser in headless mode, below is correspondling list:

- "EdgeHeadless"
- "EdgeDevHeadless"
- "EdgeBetaHeadless"
- "EdgeCanaryHeadless"

If you want to explicity specify the path for browser installation, set environment variable from this list, corresponding to release channel:

```bash
EDGE_BIN, EDGE_BETA_BIN, EDGE_DEV_BIN, EDGE_CANARY_BIN
```

Example:

```bash
# Add at top of karma.conf.js
process.env.EDGE_DEV_BIN =
  "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge Dev\\Application\\msedge.exe";

```

That's all is required to use Karma with Chromium Edge browser.

The browser can also be specified with `npm test` commmand like below:

```bash
 "coverage": "ng t --no-watch --code-coverage --reporters=junit,coverage-istanbul --browsers=EdgeHeadless --progress=false"
```

## Running from Linux Docker

For running in docker, you may get error like below:

"Edge Headless stderr: [0116/032919.925976:ERROR:zygote_host_impl_linux.cc(90)] Running as root without --no-sandbox is not supported. See https://crbug.com/638180."

Then you need to run it as non-root user or disable sandbox. Please read [sandbox design](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/design/sandbox.md) before disabling it.

This can be done using custom launcher in `karma.conf.js` using Edge launcher as base and adding extra flags as desired.

For example, for angular app, add below in `karma.conf.js`:

```js
  customLaunchers: {
    EdgeHeadlessCI: {
      base: "EdgeHeadless",
      flags: ["--no-sandbox"],
    },
  },
```

and in `package.json` use it like: `"test:edge": "ng test --no-watch --browsers=EdgeHeadlessCI"`

## Build from Source

In case if you want to build package from github source

```bash
# Clone/download the package

# Run in clonned directory to install dependencies
npm install

# Run in clonned directory
npm run package  # Generates package in tgz format

# Run in angular project
# Provide path to tgz file generated in earlier step
npm install -g <path/to/tgz>
```

The project is based on [karma-chrome-launcher
](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-chrome-launcher) as most of flags/configs for Chromium Edge are similar to Chrome browser
